description: Requirements with Gherkin scenarios (BDD) and optional user stories
generates: "specs/**/*.md"
requires: [proposal]
instruction: |
  Edit spec files that define WHAT the system should do.

  Specs describe behavior, not implementation. Do NOT include concrete
  commands (e.g., git commands), file paths, or API calls in requirement
  text or scenarios.

  Overlap Verification (before editing any spec files):
  1. Read the proposal's Consolidation Check section.
  2. For each new capability, scan existing specs in docs/specs/ for overlapping
     requirements (same actor, same trigger, same data model).
  3. If overlap is found: STOP and note it. The capability should be reclassified as
     a Modified Capability on the existing spec, not a new spec. Update the proposal's
     Capabilities section to reflect this before proceeding.

  Edit or create one spec file per capability listed in the proposal's Capabilities section.
  - New capabilities: create docs/specs/<capability>.md using the exact
    kebab-case name from the proposal.
  - Modified capabilities: edit the existing file at docs/specs/<capability>.md
    in place. Add, modify, or remove requirements as described in the proposal.

  Format requirements (strict ordering):
  1. `### Requirement: <name>` header
  2. Normative description using SHALL/MUST (mandatory — this is the requirement)
  3. Optionally: `**User Story:** As a [role] I want [goal], so that [benefit]` — captures intent and motivation. Recommended for user-facing requirements, omit for purely technical or non-functional ones.
  4. `#### Scenario: <name>` with GIVEN/WHEN/THEN format
  - **IMPORTANT**: Description MUST come before User Story. The description is the normative requirement; the User Story is supplementary context.
  - **CRITICAL**: Scenarios MUST use exactly 4 hashtags (`####`). Using 3 hashtags or bullets will fail silently.
  - Scenarios use full Gherkin: GIVEN establishes preconditions, WHEN triggers, THEN asserts.
  - Every requirement MUST have at least one scenario.

  Include an "Edge Cases" section for boundary conditions and error states.
  Mark every assumption as: `- Visible assumption text. <!-- ASSUMPTION: short tag -->`.
  The visible text must be a complete readable statement; the HTML comment is a brief tag for preflight grep.
  If zero assumptions were made, state: "No assumptions made."
  Specs should be testable — each scenario is a potential test case.

## Purpose
<!-- Brief description of what this capability does -->

## Requirements

### Requirement: <!-- requirement name -->
<!-- requirement description — use SHALL/MUST for normative statements -->

<!-- Optional: **User Story:** As a [role] I want [goal], so that [benefit]. -->

#### Scenario: <!-- scenario name -->
- **GIVEN** <!-- initial state -->
- **WHEN** <!-- action / trigger -->
- **THEN** <!-- expected outcome -->

## Edge Cases
<!-- Boundary conditions, error states, empty states, concurrency -->

## Assumptions
<!-- Format: "- Visible assumption text. <!-- ASSUMPTION: short tag -->"
     If none: state "No assumptions made." -->
