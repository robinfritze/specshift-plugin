# ADR-NNN: [Decision Title]

## Status

Accepted (YYYY-MM-DD)

## Context

<!-- Minimum 4-6 sentences. Include:
     - What motivated the decision (the problem being solved)
     - What was investigated or researched
     - Key constraints or trade-offs that shaped the decision
     Enrich with research.md "## 3. Approaches" from the same change if available.
     Do NOT write thin contexts like "we chose X over Y because Z". -->

[Context text]

## Decision

<!-- For consolidated ADRs (multiple sub-decisions):
     Use a numbered list with inline rationale via em-dash:
     1. **Sub-decision text** — rationale explaining why
     2. **Sub-decision text** — rationale explaining why

     For single-decision ADRs:
     **Decision text** — rationale explaining why

     Rationale is always inline. There is no separate Rationale section. -->

[From the Decisions table. Each decision includes its rationale inline via em-dash.]

## Alternatives Considered

- [From the Decisions table "Alternatives" column, expanded into bullet points]

## Consequences

### Positive

- [Benefits of this decision, derived from rationale, context, and positive outcomes]

### Negative

- [Drawbacks, risks, or trade-offs from design.md "Risks & Trade-offs",
   filtered to relevance for this specific decision where possible.
   If no relevant negative consequences: "No significant negative consequences identified."]
