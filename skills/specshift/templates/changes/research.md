  If existing specs are present in docs/specs/, first check whether
  they still reflect the current codebase. Note any stale-spec risks
  from code changed outside the spec process.

  Context loading guardrails:
  - Always read: docs/specs/*.md (source of truth),
    docs/README.md (architecture overview and Key Design Decisions index)
  - When relevant: docs/decisions/adr-*.md — use the Key Design
    Decisions table in docs/README.md as index; deep-dive into
    specific ADRs only when the proposed change touches an area
    with a prior decision
  - Do not read:
    docs/capabilities/*.md (derived from specs, redundant)

  Document your research findings for this feature request.
  Capture what you learned: affected code, external dependencies,
  possible approaches with trade-offs, and risks.

  Before proceeding, rate each category as Clear/Partial/Missing:
  Scope, Behavior, Data Model, UX, Integration, Edge Cases,
  Constraints, Terminology, Non-Functional Requirements.

  Only ask questions for Partial/Missing categories.
  Max 5 questions, prioritized by Impact × Uncertainty.
  If everything is Clear — state that and move on.

  After the user responds, record decisions with rationale
  in the Decisions section before proceeding.
