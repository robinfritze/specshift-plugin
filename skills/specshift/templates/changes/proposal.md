  Create the proposal document that establishes WHY this change is needed.

  Sections:
  - **Why**: 1-2 sentences on the problem or opportunity. What problem does this solve? Why now?
  - **What Changes**: Bullet list of changes. Be specific about new capabilities, modifications, or removals. Mark breaking changes with **BREAKING**.
  - **Capabilities**: Identify which specs will be created or modified:
    - **New Capabilities**: List capabilities being introduced. Each becomes a new `docs/specs/<name>.md`. Use kebab-case names (e.g., `user-auth`, `data-export`).
    - **Modified Capabilities**: List existing capabilities whose REQUIREMENTS are changing. Only include if spec-level behavior changes (not just implementation details). Each edits the existing spec file in place. Check `docs/specs/` for existing spec names. Leave empty if no requirement changes.
  - **Impact**: Affected code, APIs, dependencies, or systems.
  - **Scope & Boundaries**: Explicitly state what is and isn't part of this change.

  Capability Granularity Rules:
  - A "capability" is a cohesive domain of behavior that a user or system
    exercises independently (e.g., "data-export", "user-auth"). It typically
    has 3-8 requirements and maps to one testable surface area.
  - A "feature detail" is a single behavior, option, or edge case WITHIN a
    capability. Feature details belong as requirements inside an existing
    spec — NOT as separate specs.
  - Rule of thumb: if two proposed capabilities share the same actor, trigger,
    or data model, they are likely one capability. Merge them.
  - Target: ~250-350 lines per spec. If a proposed capability would produce
    fewer than ~100 lines (1-2 requirements), it should be folded into a
    related existing capability.

  IMPORTANT: The Capabilities section is critical. It creates the contract between
  proposal and specs phases. Each capability listed here will need a corresponding
  spec file.

  Consolidation Check (MANDATORY before finalizing Capabilities):
  1. List all existing specs in docs/specs/ and read their ## Purpose sections.
  2. For each proposed new capability, check: does an existing spec already cover
     this domain? If yes → use Modified Capabilities instead of creating a new spec.
  3. For each pair of proposed new capabilities, check: do they share an actor,
     trigger, or data model? If yes → merge them into one capability.
  4. Verify each proposed capability will have 3+ distinct requirements.
     Single-requirement "capabilities" should be folded into a related spec.

  Keep it concise (1-2 pages). Focus on the "why" not the "how" —
  implementation details belong in design.md.

## Why

<!-- Explain the motivation for this change. What problem does this solve? Why now? -->

## What Changes

<!-- Describe what will change. Be specific about new capabilities, modifications, or removals. -->

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities
<!-- Capabilities being introduced. Replace <name> with kebab-case identifier (e.g., user-auth, data-export, api-rate-limiting). Each creates docs/specs/<name>.md -->
- `<name>`: <brief description of what this capability covers>

### Modified Capabilities
<!-- Existing capabilities whose REQUIREMENTS are changing (not just implementation).
     Only list here if spec-level behavior changes.
     Use existing spec names from docs/specs/. Leave empty if no requirement changes. -->
- `<existing-name>`: <what requirement is changing>

### Removed Capabilities
<!-- Capabilities being entirely removed. Include reason and migration path.
     Leave empty if no capabilities are removed. -->
- `<existing-name>`: <reason for removal, migration path>

### Consolidation Check
<!-- MANDATORY: Show your work before finalizing the Capabilities lists above.
     1. Existing specs reviewed: [list spec names from docs/specs/ that you checked]
     2. Overlap assessment: [for each new capability, state which existing spec was closest and why this is distinct OR why you chose Modified instead]
     3. Merge assessment: [for any pair of new capabilities, state whether they share actor/trigger/data and whether they were merged]
     If no new capabilities: write "N/A — no new specs proposed." -->

## Impact

<!-- Affected code, APIs, dependencies, systems -->

## Scope & Boundaries

<!-- What is part of this change, what is not? -->
